# Intro

Polysmith is a [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) based 3D modeling software that uses [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) along with [CSG](https://github.com/giladdarshan/OctreeCSG) and [BVH](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh) in the background. It can export [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) and [OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) files to be used for 3D printing. In the future we would also like to be able to slice meshes directly in three.js and stream/export the resulting G-codes, see the [Polyslice](https://github.com/jgphilpott/polyslice) project for more info.
